# Cross-Platform Omics Pipeline for Integrated Transcriptomics

**Cr**oss-Platform **O**mic**s** **P**ipeline for **I**ntegrated **T**ranscriptomics (CrosPIT), an end-to-end single-cell analysis pipeline built on the Google Colab cloud platform with structured storage on Google Drive. This pipeline allows users to analyze million-cell datasets via online servers without requiring local high-performance computing resources, while also supporting deployment on local computing clusters with dedicated hardware. The core design principle of the framework is cross-language workflow integration, which optimizes the transcriptomic analysis paradigm.
